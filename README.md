PyBank & PyPoll Data Analysis Overview

## PyBank: Financial Data Analysis
In this project, you will develop a Python script to perform a comprehensive financial analysis of a company's performance over time. The dataset pybank.csv contains two key variables: Date and Profit/Losses, which track the companyâ€™s financial status on a monthly basis.

## Observations:

Determine the total number of months represented in the dataset.
Compute the net total of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, providing insight into the overall financial trend.
Analyze the monthly "Profit/Loss" changes, then compute the average of these monthly changes to assess the financial volatility.
Identify and report the greatest increase in profits, including both the corresponding date and amount.
Similarly, identify the greatest decrease in profits, along with the relevant date and amount.
This task involves basic time series analysis, where you'll need to manipulate date-based indices and calculate differences between consecutive periods to derive the change metrics.

## PyPoll: Election Data Analysis
In this challenge, you are tasked with streamlining the vote-counting process for a local election. The dataset, election_data.csv, includes three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Due to the size of the dataset, efficient data handling with Pandas is required to ensure fast processing and analysis.

## The analysis should yield the following:

Total number of votes cast in the election, providing the scale of the voter turnout.
A comprehensive list of candidates who received votes.
The percentage of total votes that each candidate received, allowing for an understanding of each candidate's relative support.
The total number of votes for each candidate, facilitating a breakdown of the electoral performance.
The winner of the election, determined by the highest number of votes, and identified as the candidate with the largest share of the popular vote.
The task requires proficiency in handling categorical data, applying aggregate functions, and visualizing the distribution of votes across candidates. You will also need to apply basic statistical measures, such as percentage calculations, and perform sorting and ranking operations.

## Repository Structure:

This repository contains the Python scripts and analysis outputs for both the financial and election data, organized as follows:

pybank/: Contains the Python script for financial data analysis.
pybank/budget_analysis.py: The script that processes and analyzes the financial data from budget_data.csv, generating key financial metrics.
pypoll/: Contains the Python script for election data analysis.
pypoll/election_analysis.py: The script that processes and analyzes the election data from election_data.csv, performing vote aggregation and candidate ranking.
analysis/: Contains the textual outputs generated from the analyses.
analysis/financial_analysis.txt: The output from the financial data analysis, which includes all computed financial metrics and insights.
analysis/election_results.txt: The output from the election data analysis, containing the aggregated vote totals, candidate rankings, and election outcome.
